# Aind.Behavior.Gists

A repository with random gists for anything related with Aind Behavior


## Rules of thumb

1. For each gists, open an folder
2. For each folder, make sure to use environments to ensure reproducible workflows as much as possible
    * For python, use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    * For bonsai use [environments](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/environments.html)
3. It is advised to add a readme to each gists
4. If possible add data to reproduce the gists whenever relevant
5. DO NOT add data for tests/examples. Simple files are fine, anything about 1kb, consider linking elsewhere.
